Welcome to My BBCode-ish Page! This page demonstrates a direct conversion of the BBCode syntax you provided. Even the non-standard tags are here! Basic Text Styling This is **bold text**, and this is *italic text*. Here's some __underlined text__, and this text has a ~~strikethrough~~. For special formatting, we have superscript and subscript elements. This text is explicitly set to a large size '7'. This paragraph uses a specific color defined in the BBCode sample. Links, Images & Custom Elements You can visit our [example website](http://example.com). Or, if you prefer, [send us an email](mailto:feedback@example.com)! Here's an image: [facebook url="h"] - This is a non-standard Facebook tag. In a real site, this would embed Facebook content. Code and Quotes Here's a block of code: ` function helloWorld() { console.log("Hello, BBCode World!"); } helloWorld(); ` And a quoted passage: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." - An ancient pangram. Structured Content Table Example: Row 1 column 1 Row 1 column 2 Row 2 column 1 Row 2 column 2 Div Alignments: This content is explicitly aligned to the left using the 'align' attribute. It can span multiple lines. This content is explicitly aligned to the center using the 'align' attribute. Great for headings or short messages. This content is explicitly aligned to the right using the 'align' attribute. Useful for dates or source attribution. Unordered List: First list item. Second list item with a line break in it. Third list item. A Spoiler Section: This is the hidden content of the spoiler. It only shows up after the button is clicked in a real BBCode forum. End of BBCode-inspired content.
