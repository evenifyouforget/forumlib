# Welcome to My BBCode-ish Page!

This page demonstrates a direct conversion of the BBCode syntax you provided, 
           including various combinations of text styles for robust testing.
        


## Basic and Combined Text Styling

This is **bold text**, and this is *italic text*. 
           Here's some __underlined text__, and this text has a ~~strikethrough~~. 
           For special formatting, we have superscript and subscript elements.
        
This text is explicitly set to a large size '7'.
This paragraph uses a specific color defined in the BBCode sample.
### Combinations of Styles:


            This is ***bold and italic*** text.
            This is __~~underlined and strikethrough~~__ text.
            Here's some **__bold and underlined__** text.
            Let's try *~~italic and strikethrough~~*.
        

            How about **__*bold, underlined, and italic*__**? 
            This is **bold and colored** text.
            And *large and italic* text. 
            A complex one: **__*Large, bold, underlined, italic, and colored!*__**


            Scientific notation example: H2SO4 
            Math example: E=mc2 
            A combination: **Important superscript detail**.
        


## Links, Images & Custom Elements


            You can visit our example website. 
            Or, if you prefer, send us an email!
        

            Here's an image: 



            [facebook url="h"] - This is a non-standard Facebook tag.  In a real site, this would embed Facebook content.
        


## Code and Quotes

Here's a block of code:
```
            function helloWorld() {
                  console.log("Hello, BBCode World!");
            }
            helloWorld();
        
```
And a quoted passage:

            "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." 
            - An ancient pangram.
        


## Structured Content

### Table Example:

| Row 1 column 1 | Row 1 column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 2 column 1 | Row 2 column 2 |
### Div Alignments:


            This content is explicitly aligned to the left using the 'align' attribute. 
            It can span multiple lines.
        

            This content is explicitly aligned to the center using the 'align' attribute. 
            Great for headings or short messages.
        

            This content is explicitly aligned to the right using the 'align' attribute. 
            Useful for dates or source attribution.
        
### Unordered List:

* First list item.
* Second list item with a  line break in it.
* Third list item.
* A combined list item: **Bold** and *italic* text.

### A Spoiler Section:


This is the hidden content of the spoiler.  It only shows up after the button is clicked in a real BBCode forum. 
            It can also contain ***combined*** styles itself!
